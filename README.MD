# Kadena Contracts

The purpose of this repository is to provide myself with useful contracts and code snippets that I can reuse in my various projects.

I am making them public and sharing them with anyone and everyone who wishes to use them.

If you ever need help, please reach out and I'll do my best to be of use.  
With that though, I expect people to do their own due diligence to understand things. Please don't expect me to solve all of your problems, unless you're willing to pay me to make stuff happen.  
I don't have the time, nor mental energy requisite to be boots on the ground for everyone.

Here to serve, teach, and learn along the way!
